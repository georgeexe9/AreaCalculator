=== TRIANGLES ===

1. General Triangle
- Description: Three sides a, b, c
- Area formula: 
  Area = sqrt(s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)), where s = (a + b + c) / 2  (Heron's formula)
- Perimeter formula:
  Perimeter = a + b + c

2. Equilateral Triangle
- Description: All sides equal (a)
- Area formula:
  Area = (sqrt(3) / 4) * a^2
- Perimeter formula:
  Perimeter = 3a

3. Isosceles Triangle
- Description: Two equal sides (a), base b
- Area formula:
  Area = (b / 4) * sqrt(4a^2 - b^2)
- Perimeter formula:
  Perimeter = 2a + b

4. Right Triangle
- Description: One right angle (90°), sides a, b (legs), c (hypotenuse)
- Area formula:
  Area = (1/2) * a * b
- Perimeter formula:
  Perimeter = a + b + c
- Note: c = sqrt(a^2 + b^2)

5. Acute Triangle
- Description: All angles less than 90°
- Area formula:
  Area = Heron's formula or other methods
- Perimeter formula:
  Perimeter = a + b + c

6. Obtuse Triangle
- Description: One angle greater than 90°
- Area formula:
  Area = Heron's formula or other methods
- Perimeter formula:
  Perimeter = a + b + c


=== TRAPEZOIDS ===

1. General Trapezoid
- Description: Quadrilateral with one pair of parallel sides (bases) a and b, non-parallel sides c and d, height h
- Area formula:
  Area = 0.5 * (a + b) * h
- Perimeter formula:
  Perimeter = a + b + c + d
- Notes: 
  - The height h is perpendicular distance between the bases.
  - The sum of non-parallel sides must satisfy triangle inequality constraints.

2. Isosceles Trapezoid
- Description: Trapezoid where non-parallel sides c and d are equal
- Area formula:
  Area = 0.5 * (a + b) * h  (same as general trapezoid)
- Perimeter formula:
  Perimeter = a + b + 2c
- Additional properties:
  - Non-parallel sides are equal length.
  - Base angles are equal.

3. Right Trapezoid
- Description: Trapezoid with two right angles
- Area formula:
  Area = 0.5 * (a + b) * h
- Perimeter formula:
  Perimeter = a + b + c + d
- Additional notes:
  - One of the legs (c or d) is perpendicular to the bases.

Notes on trapezoid validation:

- Bases (a and b) must be positive and parallel.
- Height h must be positive and less than or equal to the difference of the bases.
- Non-parallel sides (c and d) must satisfy triangle inequality with difference of bases.
- Height must be perpendicular to bases.
